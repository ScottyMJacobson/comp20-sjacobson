Maurauder's Map
===============

###Correctly Implemented:
* CSS File, named mmapstyle.css
* navigator.geolocation gets current location - if the process fails, Davis Square is used as a default location
* Location is displayed using "You Are Hear" Marker with InfoWindow that displays Lat, Long, and list of Distances to Characters
* Displays locations of all students with Markers with InfoWindows
* Displays locations of all characters as custom png icon with InfoWindow with location, note, ect
* Displays polylines between "You Are Hear" Marker and all characters
* Displays distance in miles (see above) in table inside of "You Are Hear" InfoWindow

###Collaborations?
* For help with creating the functor to hand to the google maps eventhandler (for populating a infowindow for each marker), I referred to stackoverflow  

###Time Spent
I think I spent about 20 hours on this assignment
