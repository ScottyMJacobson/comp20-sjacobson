================
A private repo created for me for Ming Chow's Fall 2014 COMP20 Web Programming class.

This repo was the vehicle through which we worked on and submitted projects. 

The following questions were requested of us at the end of the year:



-------


####What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

I think my favorite assignment was the whereintheworld assignment, because for the first time, I literally built an application in the cloud and have it work from any computer in the world. It was through that project that I realized the power of web programming and became especially excited about its potential (and battled the beautiful chaos that is Node.js)

####How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

Thinking back to the beginning of the course, I had little to no conception of how backend development worked at all - to me, it was just this magical thing that happens in the cloud that is impossible to run. Now, I feel empowered to approach a problem that requires backend development and feel confident that I'd be able to pull it off. On the front end, I had designed a few sites, but I had never learned things the *right* way. I now feel confident in my ability to build light apps on the front end with clean, properly modularized Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

####What was the most important thing that you learned in this course?

I think the most important thing I learned in this course was how important it is, especially within web programming, to be flexible enough to know that a framework may (and probably will) do the job better than you. With this comes the ability to choose the correct framework and quickly and efficiently get what you need out of it regardless of the state of its documentation. I was particularly proud of my adoption of Mongoose on the backend over the course of working on the semester project, as well as the use of the node-geolocation module for the whereintheworld project.

####Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

I am excited to delve deeper into the world of backend development, and explore the world of real-time data with frameworks such as Meteor and Derby. The sheer vastness of the world of web programming is both terrifying and exciting at the same time, and it moves quickly enough that you always have to stay on your toes if you're going to be on top of the latest and greatest technology.
